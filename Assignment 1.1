2.3 V's of Big Data
1.Velocity
The rate the at which data is generated and changed.
2.Variety
The number of different data sources and types.
3.Volume
The average quantity of data units per category.

3.Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling
Horizontal Scaling - Horizontal scaling divides the data set and distributes the data over multiple 
servers, or shards. So, you can create 10instance each with 1TB database. Each shard is an independent
database, and collectively, the shardsmake up a single logical database. 
Vertical Scaling - Suppose you have 10TB database in a mid size amazon machine instance.You can easily 
say that high query rates can exhaust your servers CPU power, can consume all of your RAM and sometimes
you will find the working data set is exceeding yourstorage capacity.

4.Need and Working of Hadoop
Hadoop is an open source platform that provides excellent data management
provision. It is a framework that supports the processing of large data sets in a distributed computing
environment. It is designed to expand from single servers to thousands of machines, each providing 
computation and storage It is quite expensive to build bigger servers with heavy configurations that handle
large scale processing, but as an alternative, you can tie together many commodity computers with single-CPU,
as a single functional distributed system and practically, the clustered machines can read the dataset in
parallel and provide a much higher throughput. Moreover, it is cheaper than one high-end server. So this is
the first motivational factor behind using Hadoop that it runs across clustered and low-cost machines.
